Scanner Part of the Project

Use scanner.cpp to write your scanner so that it will
move smoothly onto the parser.

In scannertest2, the 2nd column are words causing lexical errors.
 
Check your outputs against correctoutput1 and correctoutput2 

Do NOT read from the file reservedword.text.
Just use the file content to hard code it.

main() should not be reading from the file, the read should be in scanner.

Compile your scanner on Empress!!! 

/cs/submitIt_LK G# group#scanner.out
along with scannerWork.txt with required info.

/cs/checkIt_LK G# 
can be used to get my feedback later.
