Parser Part of the Project

Use parser.cpp to do your parser so that 
it will move smoothly onto the translator.

Use the provided test cases - read the comments in them first.
Be sure to check correctoutput for cases 1 and 6.
Be sure to check OutputEC.txt for case 2 and 3 error correction for EC.


Compile your Parser on Empress!!!

/cs/submitIt_LK G# group#parser.out
 along with required info in parserWork.txt

/cs/checkIt_LK G# 
can be used to get my feedback.
